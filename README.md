# Fake Social Media Frontend
This is the react.ts ⚛️ frontend for my Fake Social Media.
My code is complete garbage because I treated this project as something to learn from as opposed to something to show off with.
I view this repo and project as a part of my growth and really appreciate it the way it is ❤️.
The technologies used are:<br>
    React TypeScript <br>
    Styled-Components<br>
    React-Router<br>
    Axios<br>
    usehooks-ts<br>
    Moment.js<br>
    tippy.js<br>
    emoji-picker-react<br>
Here is a sneak peak of the UI:
