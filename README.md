# mockup-chat
Web chat mockup
This is the react.js frontend for my chat.
The app is fullstack with a fastapi-api which is also deployed on heroku.
My code is complete garbage. Most of it is written that was just because I am lazy af.
The technologies used are:
  React JS with TypeScript
    Styled Components
    React-Router
    Axios
    usehooks-ts
    Moment.js
    tippy.js
    emoji-picker-react
    The corresponding types for each library listed aswell..
  FastAPI
    starlette
    pydantic
    sqlalchemy
    sqlite

The project is in no way done, I will be commiting in the coming days!
My view for this is to make is feel better in terms of UI and functionalities.
